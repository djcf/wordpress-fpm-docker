Problem: nginx cant access socket

Sympton: nginx returns null data when php is activated and socket write error in systemctl/docker error log

* Make sure nginx is in www-data group
	sudo usermod -aG www-data nginx
* Change nginx user to www-data
* Make sure socket is mounted using docker and visible by both sides
* Make sure nginx and fpm are talking to the same socket (file loc, host, etc.

	** STATUS: NOT FIXED

Problem: nginx 500 -- sockets not created

Sympton: nginx returns error 500 when php is activated, and no wake socket is created by systemd in /var/run/docker-apps on host

Fix: systemd needs to enable the waker service (which symlinks the socket service description into wants-socket.target) and start the waker (which creates the socket):

	systemctl enable vhost.fpm-waker.socket
	systemctl start vhost.fpm-waker.socket

	** STATUS: NOT FIXED

Problem: nginx 500, waker socket not created and systemd refuses to create it:

	Nov 24 11:26:05 jessie systemd[1]: Starting vhost.fpm-waker.socket.
	Nov 24 11:26:05 jessie systemd[1]: Socket service vhost.fpm-waker.service already active, refusing.
	Nov 24 11:26:05 jessie systemd[1]: Failed to listen on vhost.fpm-waker.socket.

Fix: Run the following:

	systemctl stop vhost.fpm-waker.socket 
	systemctl disable vhost.fpm-waker.socket 
	Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/vhost.fpm-waker.socket.
	systemctl stop vhost.fpm-waker.service 
	systemctl disable vhost.fpm-waker.service 

	** STATUS: Unknown what causes this issue.

Problem: containers may take some time to activate and the socket may not be ready for them

Fix: ensure sockets are handed to waitport.sh which wraps netcat to wait for the container to be ready.
