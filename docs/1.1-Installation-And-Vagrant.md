## Installation (Remote)

First, it has to be installed somewhere. A vagrant file is provided so you can run the system locally, otherwise you need to run the ansible plays `ansible/plays/system/install-web.yml` and `ansible/plays/system/configure-web.yml`

Both of these scripts are run automatically with vagrant. Just run `vagrant up` in the project directory.

After that, you need to perform routine tasks using Ansible. See the `ansible` directory for information about how to do that.

## System Requirements

The system requirements for the host which runs ansible is unclear, but here's a good sample:

* pip, with jmespath
* vagrant
* the latest version of ansible you can find. this repo was built with ansible 2.2, but some features will not work until ansible 2.3.
* When these requirements are met, you should install ansible roles using the requirements file:

    cd ansible
    ansible-galaxy -r requirements.yml

## Local Development (using Vagrant)

You can obtain an exact copy of the production environment for local testing and dev work using vagrant. Vagrant will automatically use the ansible scripts and docker-compose file to get the container assembly up and running:

    $ vagrant up; vagrant ssh

To run playbooks against the local vagrant host, run this command:

	export INVENTORY=$(pwd)/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory

Or in fish: 

	set $inventory (pwd)/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory
