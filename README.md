Docker wordpress fpm

What is it?

It will eventually be a control infrastructure for running containerised wordpress fleets using init to kill them when not in use.

For now, it is only a way to install wordpress into a docker container with fpm. It assumes that you already have a MYSQL database and Nginx container ready to compose with them.
