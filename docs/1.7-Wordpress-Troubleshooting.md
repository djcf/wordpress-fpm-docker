## What do you need to do?
#### I need to add/edit a primary domain for Wordpress
This is easy. Just run the `renew-vhost` ansible script.

If you want to do it manually, read on. First you have to know whether the wordpress site is running in the php group-fpm container or is a standalone on-demand container.

**On-demand containers** have their wp-config variables populated by their container environment, which lives in `/var/www/$domain/.env`. Just edit the .env file and make sure that HTTP_HOST reflects the new domain or add it if it doesn't exist. Then run `/usr/local/bin/renew-fpm-container.sh $primary_subdomain` to create a new container with the modified environment.

**Group-fpm containers** have their wp-config variables populated by the php-pool they run under. So you need to edit the php pool associated with the php-fpm group container -- read on.

##### I need to edit the php pools associated with the php-fpm group container

* Edit template: https://labs.noflag.org.uk/Noflag/web-two-point-oh/src/master/ansible/roles/group-php-fpm/templates/php-pool.j2
* View/edit pools: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/group-fpm-pools/_data`

Then restart the container:

    docker stop wordpress-group.fpm
    docker start wordpress-group.fpm

##### I need to edit the single php pool associated with an on-demand container

* Edit template: https://labs.noflag.org.uk/Noflag/web-two-point-oh/src/master/docker/apps/wordpress/www.conf
* View/edit pools: 

    docker start $domain.fpm
    docker exec -it $domain.fpm ash
    cd /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d

##### I need to add/edit Wordpress wp-config.php

Check the settings in /var/$domain/.env and restart the container. If you still need to do that, you can create a file named wp-config-inc.php in /var/$domain; it will be automatically included inside the wp-config file when either the ansible create script is re-run, or immediately for php-group containers.

#### I need to add/edit special vhost directives for this domain

Of course you can prototype your changes in /var/lib/docker/volumes/docker_sites_enabled/_data, but to make the changes permanent you should create a new file named $domain.conf in /var/lib/docker/volumes/docker_vhost_inc/_data. That file will be automatically included by ansible next time the create script is run, or by dockergen if you're dealing with a fully-containerized (non-Wordpress) app.

For on-demand containers, after you edit the env file, you need to restart the container. The best way is to do this using ansible to re-run the create-wordpress script.

Group-fpm containers do not use the .env file. Instead, each php pool injects its own WP config straight into the wp-config file. So you should see "I need to edit the php pools associated with the php-fpm group container" above instead.

#### I need to renew a vhost

Common reasons to want to renew a vhost without touching the underlying website:

* Adding a new domain, e.g. example.org to example.noflag.org.uk.
* Removing an expired top-level domain from the base site
* Adding an SSL certificate
* Re-creating the vhost after creating a file named $primary_subdomain.conf in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/docker_vhost_config`. This will prompt ansible to automatically include the contents of the file in the vhost template.

This is as simple as running `ansible/renew-vhost.yml`.
