## Naming

Where possible, containers should always be named after a FQDN where they can be accessed, for example `sqldb.common.scot`. Even though SQLDB cannot be accessed from the internet, it in theory could be, and there might be reasons why you would need that. So it gets named after its FQDN.

This rule is relaxed where it doesn't make sense for a container to be web-accessible. For example, `dockergen` runs a utility script which generates nginx config files. It's not a server, so it doesn't get named after a FQDN. Likewise `docker-compose`. This rule is borderline for things which are extremely generic (too generic to name properly) like the vhost master proxy, simply named `switchboard` or too specific to name properly like Wordpress fpm containers which always live sandwiched between switchboard and SQLDB.

This is *always* the case for containers which bundle an HTTP server, one of many tests for true 12-factor compliance.
