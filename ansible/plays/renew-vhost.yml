      *** Primary subdomain **
      ALL websites must have a primary subdomain associated with them and parked to the domain host.
      This is to ensure the website is able to stay active even if control over the top-level domain is lost or expires.
      It will be used as a unique key to identify this user's domain.
      For example, for 'example.common.scot', enter 'example'.
      Enter a primary subdomain

  #     ** Domain zones ** If any domains entered above have zones other than the primary zone, enter them here. 
  #     A zone is ussually equvilent to the top-level domain in a hierachy (e.g. for 'extra domain' "test.example.org", the zone is 'example.org')
  #     There must be a 1-1 mapping with the extra domains you entered s.t. each extra domain corresponds to a zone in this list.
  #     If you press enter without typing a zone, either the primary zone will be used or all extra domains entered will also become zones."
