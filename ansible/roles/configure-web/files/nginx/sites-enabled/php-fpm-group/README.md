vhosts in this directory are part of the GROUP php-fpm container. This is an always-active and multi-user container which is used to run php. At the moment it is only configured to run wordpress, though that could change in the future.

The opposite of sites in the php-fpm group container are sites which run in their own, isolated world container, generally named $primary_subdomain.fpm. Those sites ussually started on demand by systemd, instead of being always active like these ones.
