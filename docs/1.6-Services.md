SERVICES
-------

The systemd.services file contains service definitions which you can use to talk directly to the main containers. For example, one can run:

    service nginx reload

or

    service mysql stop

And expect that these services will perform appropriately.

You can also refer to each vhost by its domain, e.g.:

	service fpm@mydomain stop

Since systemd would by default talk to the docker client process and not the docker daemon, we use https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/systemd-docker. It's a simple proxy which lets systemd be kept in touch with container activity. Without it, `service $name status` would always show the status of the docker client binary, and not the status of the container.
