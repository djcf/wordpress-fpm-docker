SERVICES
-------

The systemd.services file contains service definitions which you can use to talk directly to the main containers. For example, one can run:

    service nginx reload

    or

    service mysql stop

And expect that these services will perform appropriately.

You can also refer to each vhost by its domain, e.g.:

	service fpm@mydomain.org stop

See also this useful list of systemd commands: https://www.dynacont.net/documentation/linux/Useful_SystemD_commands/ (more detail: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units). For more information about running docker containers as systemd processes, check here http://container-solutions.com/running-docker-containers-with-systemd/, here https://goldmann.pl/blog/2014/07/30/running-docker-containers-as-systemd-services/ and here http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/05/05/running-systemd-within-docker-container/.

Since systemd would by default talk to the docker client process and not the docker daemon, we use https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/systemd-docker to allow sane communication between docker services between the docker and systemd daemons.
